xorg-launch-helper
==================

About:

Xorg-launch-helper is a small utility that transforms the X server
process (XOrg) into a daemon that can be used to make applications
wait with starting until XOrg is ready for X11 connections.

The utility starts and forks the XOrg server and listens for a
signal from the XOrg server. At this point, the utility exits
and this mimics a forking daemon. The systemd process notices
the fork/exec, and because the xorg.service file tells systemd
that Type=forking, systemd understands that the XOrg service
unit is now active.

This mechanism can be used to delay the starting up of services
that require a working X11 display server, such as any form
of graphical process or X11 window manager.


Origin:

xorg-launch-helper is a minimal version of uxlaunch - a replacement
session launcher Arjan van der Ven and me originally wrote for
Moblin. With systemd, most of the uxlaunch code has become obsolete,
and systemd does almost everything a lot better.
